# Plant-Disease-Prediction-with-CNN
This project implements a Plant Disease Prediction System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify plant leaf images into healthy or diseased categories. The model learns visual patterns such as color variations, texture, and shape from leaf images to accurately identify plant diseases.
